# hello-world
My first repository :)

Hi. My name is Tezcatlipoca.
I'm teaching myself how to code.
I thought it would be a good idea to start with web related languajes cause I thought it would be an easy begining.
So far I know a little bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I'm taking all the courses in FreeCodeCamp.
I already got the responsibe web design certification :)
